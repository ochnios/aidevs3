Task solutions were created with the help of [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/), 
using LLMs to generate code is also part of the course.
I try to solve each task without touching the code and asking Cursor to fix any issues. 
In most cases, Cursor creates correct solution in one go! Obviously, only when I provide 
a correct prompt with all necessary details.
