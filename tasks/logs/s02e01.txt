 Reasoning:
1. **Adam's Testimony**: Adam confuses Andrzej with Arkadiusz Maj and provides an address in Wałbrzych, which is irrelevant to Andrzej's university location.
2. **Agnieszka's Testimony**: Agnieszka mentions Andrzej moving from Warsaw to Kraków to teach something related to informatics or mathematics, suggesting a university in Kraków.
3. **Ardian's Testimony**: Ardian does not provide specific information about Andrzej's university location but acknowledges his scientific achievements.
4. **Michał's Testimony**: Michał mentions Andrzej's ambition to work at a prestigious university, referring to it as a "royal university," which aligns with the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, known for its historical prestige.
5. **Monika's Testimony**: Monika confirms Andrzej worked in Kraków, specifically mentioning the Faculty or Institute of Informatics and Computer Mathematics, which aligns with the Jagiellonian University.
6. **Rafał's Testimony**: Rafał makes a cryptic reference to "Jagiełło," which could imply the Jagiellonian University, founded by King Władysław II Jagiełło. He also mentions a street related to a mathematician, which could be a clue to the faculty's location.

Analysis:
- The consistent mention of Kraków and references to a prestigious or "royal" university strongly suggest the Jagiellonian University.
- Monika's specific mention of the Faculty or Institute of Informatics and Computer Mathematics aligns with the known faculties at the Jagiellonian University.
- Rafał's cryptic mention of "Jagiełło" and a mathematician-related street further supports the Jagiellonian University, as it is historically linked to King Jagiełło.

Verification:
- The Jagiellonian University in Kraków is one of Poland's most prestigious and historically significant universities, fitting Michał's description of a "royal university."
- The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Jagiellonian University is located on Łojasiewicza Street, named after the mathematician Stanisław Łojasiewicz, which aligns with Rafał's mention of a mathematician-related street.

Answer:
Łojasiewicza

Found street name: Łojasiewicza
